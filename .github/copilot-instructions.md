# Real-Time Financial AI Application with Pathway

This project is a real-time market anomaly detection system built for the Pathway LiveAI Hackathon.

## Key Technologies:

- **Pathway**: Real-time data streaming and processing framework
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: For intelligent explanations
- **LangChain/LangGraph**: For agentic workflows
- **FastAPI**: For REST API endpoints
- **Streamlit**: For interactive dashboard
- **OpenAI/Gemini**: For LLM capabilities

## Project Focus:

- Real-time data ingestion from financial APIs
- Live vector indexing and hybrid search
- Dynamic anomaly detection with AI explanations
- Agentic workflows for autonomous monitoring
- Real-time dashboard with live updates

## Coding Guidelines:

- Use Pathway for all streaming data operations
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow Python best practices with type hints
- Create modular, reusable components
